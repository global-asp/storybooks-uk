<h2>About us</h4>

<div class="container">

<p>Storybooks UK is designed specifically for educators and makes 40 stories from the <a href="http://africanstorybook.org/" target="_blank">African Storybook</a> available in English and other commonly-spoken languages, as well as the major national, immigrant and refugee languages of the UK. With Storybooks UK it is possible to read and listen to the same story in multiple languages. This can be done by inviting students to choose a bilingual version of the story that is being read in class, so that they will have access to the English and home language version of the story. Similarly, the audio versions of the stories (in English or another language) can support beginning readers and language learners in making the connection between speech and text.
</p>

<h4>Source of stories</h4>
<p>
All 40 stories on the Storybooks UK website come from the <a href="http://africanstorybook.org/" target="_blank">African Storybook</a> â€“ a groundbreaking digital initiative of the South African organization <a href="http://www.saide.org.za/" target="_blank">Saide</a>, which promotes literacy for African children. The African Storybook has over 700 stories in multiple African languages, as well as English, French, and Portuguese. The stories are openly licensed, which allows the Storybooks UK team to repurpose them for a UK audience. We are very grateful to the African Storybook and Saide for making the stories freely available under an open license.
</p>

<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
<p>Storybooks UK has only been possible with the help of a large number of people, including translators, readers, proofreaders, and others who have been part of the process of making these stories available.</p>

<p>We are particularly grateful to the <a href="http://storybookscanada.ca">Storybooks Canada</a> project, which has created the modular website on which Storybooks UK is based.</p>
